      <h3>History of EcmaScript</h3>
      <h4>ECMAScript is abbreviated as ES or (European Computer Manufacturers Association Script). On April 27, 1960, a group of European manufacturers met in Brussels to develop a set of operational procedures such as programming and other input and output codes. ECMAScript is a JavaScript subset. At its foundation, JavaScript is ECMAScript, although it extends it. ActionScript, JavaScript, and JScript are all ECMAScript-based languages. AS/JS/JScript are three separate cars, yet they all have the same engine... Each of their exteriors, on the other hand, is distinct, with many alterations made to each to make it one-of-a-kind. The Ecma Technical Committee 39 (commonly known as TC39) was established to continue to develop the language, with ECMA-262 Ed. being released in June 1997. The official standard is called ECMAScript, and JavaScript is the most well-known implementation of it.</h4>
      <h3>Why choose EcmaScript?</h3>
      <h4>It's a JavaScript standard that ensures web page compatibility across multiple browsers. ECMAScript is a popular client-side scripting language on the Internet, and it's becoming more popular for creating server applications and services using Node. js. In ES6, having a single helpful declarative pattern simplifies the use of class patterns and improves compatibility. They're just a sugar coating on top of the prototype-based OO pattern. Classes provide inheritance, instance, and static methods, making ES6 a more friendly version of Javascript.</h4>
